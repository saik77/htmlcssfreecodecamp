            <ul>
                <li>Doge is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013.The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year</li>
                <br>
                <li>Doge uses two-word phrases in which the first word is almost always one of five modifiers ("so", "such", "many", "much", and "very"), and the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word that it cannot properly modify.</li>
